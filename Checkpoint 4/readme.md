# Project Update - Checkpoint 4 Files

As part of the update to handle large files, I've created a new repository to store the checkpoint files and related assets for the **Fake Review Detection** project. The new repository is now the official location for **Checkpoint 4** files.

Please visit the new repository here for the latest files and project updates:

**[Project_WoC_7.0_Fake_Review_Detection - Checkpoint 4](<https://github.com/Krisha2000/Project_WoC_7.0_Fake_Review_Detection_Chechpoint_4.git>)**

In the new repository, you will find the following:
- **Frontend and Backend Code**: The Streamlit app, web scraping scripts, and model loading functionality.
- **Checkpoint 4 Deliverables**: The necessary files for Fake Review Detection, including models and related scripts.
- **Instructions**: A detailed guide on running the app and using the features, including review classification and CSV export.

Please use the new repository for all **Checkpoint 4** materials.
