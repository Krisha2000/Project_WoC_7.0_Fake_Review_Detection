The alternate and DPI buttons are tactile, although they require a pretty deep push, but then the left and right buttons are soft and have no click to them. No issues with connectivity to a Windows laptop. The mouse doesn't glide quietly and smoothly when sliding on the table directly. I would recommend using a mouse pad with it. The LED lights look nice on the mouse.Read more","Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2025"
Anonymous,5.0,"My daughter needed a new gaming mouse and this mouse offers a sleek and comfortable design, perfect for gaming. It rolls smoothly. The design and light up feature are awesome and make it that much more appealing. Don't get me wrong, it's no top-quality mouse. It works, the charge seems to be long lasting, and it's pretty. Pretty things will keep most girls attention and keep them smiling lol. It does what we needed it to do. I recommend!Read more","Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2025"

Anonymous,5.0,"This Bluetooth Mouse Wireless Gaming Mouse, 2.4G Cordless Mouse arrived well packaged and in good condition. The mouse looks and feels similar to other brand-named devices that I have owned. This was ordered specifically for our teenager, who got her first gaming laptop as a birthday present. She has been using the mouse for several days and says she likes it very much. She loves the LED color patterns produced by the mouse. She says the mouse buttons are similar to her older mouse. She says the movement and accuracy work great and she loves the fine tuning that allow customizing the mouse behavior. One thing that she doesn't like is that she has to plug the mouse in to charge it. Her previous mouse had charging pad where she just placed the mouse on the pad, and it would start charging. But that's just what she's used to.  Overall, she likes this gaming mouse. We recommend this mouse, especially for young gamers like ours.Read more","Reviewed in the United States on December 21, 2024"
